        <h1>Find a club or organization near you </h1>
        <p>We are committed to helping you discover nearby clubs and organizations that empower 
            girls with opportunities to learn, grow, and excel in coding. Our goal is to connect 
            you with spaces that foster a supportive and inclusive environment, enabling young girls 
            to develop their coding skills and thrive in the world of technology. Together, we can 
            create a community that promotes diversity, equality, and a passion for STEM education 
            among girls. Let's embark on this journey of discovery and empowerment together!</p>
