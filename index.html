            <p class="ourMission">We are committed to helping you discover nearby clubs and organizations that empower 
                girls with opportunities to learn, grow, and excel in coding. Our goal is to connect 
                you with spaces that foster a supportive and inclusive environment, enabling young girls 
                to develop their coding skills and thrive in the world of technology. Together, we can 
                create a community that promotes diversity, equality, and a passion for STEM education 
                among girls. Let's embark on this journey of discovery and empowerment together!</p>
